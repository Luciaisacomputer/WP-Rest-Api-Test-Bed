Test out the WordPress Rest API on your own site. No JS or Ajax knowledge required. 

== Description ==

My goal with this plugin is to provide a simple way for anyone to see how the endpoints in the Rest API work on their own website. There will be a simple GUI that you can use to pull your content and display the JSON data, while also giving you a small tutorial on how to modify the requests to get specific information. 


== Installation ==
1. You'll need V2 of the WP REST API which is here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/
2. Upload the `wp-rest-api-test-bed` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Go to Settings and then WP Rest API Test Bed

1. This screen shot description corresponds to screenshot-1.(png|jpg|jpeg|gif). Note that the screenshot is taken from
the /assets directory or the directory that contains the stable readme.txt (tags or trunk). Screenshots in the /assets
directory take precedence. For example, `/assets/screenshot-1.png` would win over `/tags/4.3/screenshot-1.png`
(or jpg, jpeg, gif).

            "Markdown is what the parser uses to process much of the readme file"

Markdown uses email style notation for blockquotes and I've been told:
> Asterisks for *emphasis*. Double it up  for **strong**.

`<?php code(); // goes in backticks ?>`
