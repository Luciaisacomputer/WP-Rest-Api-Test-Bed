Test out the WordPress Rest API on your own site. No JS or Ajax knowledge required. 

== Description ==

My goal with this plugin is to provide a simple way for anyone to see how the endpoints in the Rest API work on their own website. There will be a simple GUI that you can use to pull your content and display the JSON data, while also giving you a small tutorial on how to modify the requests to get specific information. 


== Installation ==
1. You'll need V2 of the WP REST API which is here: https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/
2. Upload the `wp-rest-api-test-bed` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
3. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
4. Go to Settings and then WP Rest API Test Bed
